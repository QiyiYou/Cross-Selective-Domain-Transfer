Lab-made hand-dorsa vein: It is provided with imdb format, and the original .jpg files is under further improvement.

.m functions under 'Fine-tune VGG' files provide interface for fine-tuning VGG model
Note that MatConvNet and VLfeat is needed and should be downloaded and compiled by yourself

.m functions under 'ResNet-Finetune-Train' files provide interface for training ResNet from scratch with different layer configuration and also differrent datasets are supported, and also ResNet fine-tune is supported only with some simple modification.
Note that MatConvNet and VLfeat is needed and should be downloaded and compiled by yourself
